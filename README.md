## Introduction

The next job is to build a quiz using JavaScript as the main tool, with the help HTML and CSS.

This quiz consists of a start button, which starts a 60-second timer and randomly displays questions, which if answered correctly add up to score, and if the answer is wrong, it subtracts time from the timer.

Finally, once the quiz is finished, it shows the score obtained and gives the option to write down the name, saving the name in a local variable along with the result. This data will be saved locally and displayed on a score board, where only the top 3 will be displayed.
